# Sass project setup
create a `partial` for the following files in a folder (module) called `abstracts`

- reset
- variables
- mixins

In the `absracts` folder create a `index.scss` file, be sure to `forward` the created partials out of the `abstracts` module.


Be sure to bring in the `abstracts` module into the `index.scss` before continuing on.

> NOTE: The `index.scss` is where we will house all styles for the project
